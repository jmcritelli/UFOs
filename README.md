# UFOs

## Purpose of Project:
In this project we are helping Dana create an html page using java script file that has loads of UFO sighting information. We will be writing a code that allows us to display the data in tables and then add filters to it so other viewers can sort through it with ease. 

## Results:
### How to search the webpage for specific sightings:
1.	First, you will need to pick a key piece of info about the sighting you are searching for. Each column in the table has a corresponding filter in the search section, so it will be useful if the piece of info was specific to one of the column titles (Date, location, etc). 
2.	You will need to type in the exact detail you are searching for in the corresponding search box and then press enter!

## Summary:
While this webpage can be very useful for UFO sightings, the main drawback is that there is no place to give comments or feedback. As the last sentence of the description, it says “let us know what you see.” To me, there is some implication that they are wanting to create a forum to discuss UFOs and/or the creator is wanting you to provide your own sighting stories. Moving forward, we might want to include a comment box of some sort to be able to let everyone openly discuss the data. Another recommendation I would make would be to expand the data. Currently the only dates are from 2010. If there isn’t going to be a place for people to provide other data, we might want to add more. This might mean we would need to expand the webpage to have different sections and pages so its not all on one page but it would make it tidier.
